## About <a id="about"></a>

This project was inspired by the many nights of Super Smash Bros. Melee with my friend Santi. We always say that the last game was for "all the marbles"â€”the winner of the final match takes it all. 
To remember these many moments, I created this project to track and visualize our match data.

Originally designed for just the two of us, I expanded it to accommodate groups of players, providing a way to record and analyze matches.
